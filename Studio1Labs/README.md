### Patient Monitoring Dashboard 
### (Published on [EETimes Asia](https://www.eetasia.com/covid-19-getting-to-grips-with-respiration/))

#### Aims: Respiratory and Position monitor system for patient on our bedsheet device

#### 3D figures below represent the patient's posture and location currently on our device, with special algorithms, we can then filter out the chest location and do the signal processing to present breathing pattern of the patient.

### Reinforce the 3D Visualization of the positional data
#### Aims: Strengthen the visualization with mathematical signal processing procedure.
