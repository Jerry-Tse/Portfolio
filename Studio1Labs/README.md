### Patient Monitoring Dashboard
### (Published on [EETimes Asia](https://www.eetasia.com/covid-19-getting-to-grips-with-respiration/))

#### Aims: Respiratory and Position monitor system for patient on our bedsheet device

#### 3D figures below represent the patient's posture and location currently on our device, and with some signal processing procedure, we can filter out the breathing pattern of the patient.

### Reinforce the 3D Visualization of the positional data
#### Aims: Strengthen the visualization with mathematical signal processing procedure.

#### Left is the graph directly drawn from the raw data, after smoothing and singal processing procedures, we are able to output informative graph(posture and location) as the right one.

### User Interface Visualization
#### Aims: To monitor real time patient's condition. In charge of connecting InfluxDB, data processing and WebAPI to dump data to front-end.
